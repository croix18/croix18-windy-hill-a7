Two faces. A printed page is set in STIX, as it always was. A SLIDE is set in Lexend (ruling 40):
digits, letters, signs and words inside an expression come from the slide font, and only what
Lexend does not carry — the radical, grown brackets, arrows — comes from STIX. See lexend_tex().

The index is MERGED, never rebuilt (HOUSE STYLE §2: "No generator rebuilds an index. Ever.").
